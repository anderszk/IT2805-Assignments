                        Hello! I have quite a diversed skillset, coming from a study focusing on microcontrollers and electronics. 
                        I have done some work in HTML/JS/CSS through school projects and hobby projects. 
                        Additionally, i am currently learning react.js and vue.js this semester.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        My expectations for myself for this course are high, considering this being a introductory course in webtechnologies. I have also
                        completed some courses (TTM4100 and IELET2001) focusing on datacommunication and architectures.
    
                    </p>
                    <p class="para" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        From this course, I expect learning all the good practices when coming to web-developing. I excpect to  enjoy having projects and the assignments,
                        as it will be a nice refreshment for the technology all of the new frameworks are based on.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div style="padding-left: 50px;">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The inline overrides because it loads "closest" to the element, and it is hierarchical the highest priority
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ID is good to use if you want to customize one single element with a unique styling. This is only applicable once,
                            as #id is unique.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            RGBA is an acronym for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha, where the three first parameters chooses the color, while the
                            alpha defines the opacity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We include the .css-file in the header because we want to load it before the content of the website.
                            This is because the website loads the elements or the contents of the page with the styling from the
                            .css-file implemented.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            .article p {} would change the styling for all the paragraph text in the article div.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
