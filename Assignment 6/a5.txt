1, I will evaluate to False because Javascript uses binary floating-point numbers, which means that the result is a
product of an exponent and a mantissa, which will rarely result in a clean integer.

2, The method-attribute of a form defines how the data should be sent. the GET-method will pass it to the URL, while
the POST-method will pass it as a HTTP post transaction.

3, This is because the server will return the data from the form in the URL. idk? It's just how itizz

4, Validation with only HTML and JS is a bad practise because it is all on the front-end side, which is exposed directly
to the user. This means that it is vulnerable to changes, errors and manipulation from the client-side.

5, If you have a longer piece of text or a message it would be appropriate with a textarea, as input is primarly one-lined.
