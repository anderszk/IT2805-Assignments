                        Hello! I have quite a diversed skillset, coming from a study focusing on microcontrollers and electronics. 
                        I have done some work in HTML/JS/CSS through school projects and hobby projects. 
                        Additionally, i am currently learning react.js and vue.js this semester.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        My expectations for myself for this course are high, considering this being a introductory course in webtechnologies. I have also
                        completed some courses (TTM4100 and IELET2001) focusing on datacommunication and architectures.
    
                    </p>
                    <p class="para" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        From this course, I expect learning all the good practices when coming to web-developing. I excpect to  enjoy having projects and the assignments,
                        as it will be a nice refreshment for the technology all of the new frameworks are based on.
                    </p>
